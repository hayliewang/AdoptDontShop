  <h2>Chanel</h2>
  <p>Chanel is my family's first dog. She's a shih-tzu and is currently 9 years old. We got her when she was only 8 weeks old. Her fur is a mixture of different shades of brown, but there's also a little bit of white you can find on her body. She was our only dog for about 6 years until we got our second dog. At first, she was hesitant, but now they've warmed up to each other and like to play together.</p>
