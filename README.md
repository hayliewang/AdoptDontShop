  <h2>When/Why did I Start?</h2>
  <p>Before playing basketball, I did iceskating, but I never really enjoyed it. So instead, my parents put my sister and me in basketball when I was six years old, just to try it out. Immediately, I realized that I enjoyed playing basketball significantly more than iceskating. I liked the idea that it was a team sport, and I liked being part of a team. During my first few years playing basketball, I only played on one team, but as I played longer, I started joining other teams, whether it just be for fun, or competitive.</p>
