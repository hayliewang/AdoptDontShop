<h1>Chanel</h1>
<p>Chanel is my family's first dog. She's a nine-year-old shih-tzu and we got her when she was only 8 weeks old. I remember being so happy to finally get a dog after begging my parents for years. Her fur is brown and she has dark, big eyes. Anyone who sees her for the first time always points out how her eyes are so big. She was our only dog until she was 5 years old, when we got our second dog.</p>

<p>Luna is our family's second dog. She's a golden retriever and we got her in 2019 when she was just 10 weeks old. Luna has golden fur with some white mixed in. She's our more playful, dog. She enjoys attention and loves to play with Chanel even though she's old. Whenever she's around new people, she loves to greet them and overall just spend time with them.</p>
