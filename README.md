<p>Today, shelters are overpopulated with animals without homes. Because of this overpopulation, shelters need to put dogs down in order to make room for the other animals that don't have a home. By choosing to adopt, you too could end up saving the lives of several animals who need loving homes. However, people continue to shop for puppies, which come from puppy mills, who are known for breeding dogs for the sole purpose of making profit. The dogs that are bred from these breeders/puppy mills are usually inbred, which results in a poor-quality life for them.</p>
