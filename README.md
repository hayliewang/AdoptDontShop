# Basketball
## When Did I Start Playing?
I started playing basketball when I was 6 years old. Before playing basketball, I did iceskating for several years, but I didn't really like it. So instead, I decided that I wanted to play basketball. Immediately when I started playing, I realized that this was a sport I enjoyed way more than iceskating.
## Where Am I Now?
Now I am on a competitive travel team and a starter on the Whitney girls' basketball team.
