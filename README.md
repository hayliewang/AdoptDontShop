# Basketball
## When Did I Start Playing?
I started playing basketball when I was 6 years old. Before playing basketball, I did iceskating for several years, but I didn't really like it. So instead, I decided that I wanted to play basketball. Immediately when I started playing, I realized that this was a sport I enjoyed way more than iceskating and it has been the sport that I have stuck to since. Since then, I have dedicated lots of my time practicing and getting better to where I am now.
## Where Am I Now?
Today, I am on a competitive travel team and am a starter on the varsity basketball team in my school. Because I have been on a club team for so long, I have been able to travel to many different places. From this past year alone, I have been to Las Vegas, San Diego, and Chicago two times with my travel team. For school, we have gone to Boise, Idaho and Palm Springs. Playing basketball has allowed me to be able to go to places I've never been to before.
